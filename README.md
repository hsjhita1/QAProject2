## Project Brief <a name="projectbrief"></a>
The purpose of this project was to create a service-orientated architecture for an application. The application must be composed of at least 4 services which work together.

### Scope & Additional Requirements <a name="scopeadditional"></a>
In addition to the project brief, there are a set of requirements which the project will also have to meet. These requirements are as followed:
* An Asana board
  * Should also provide a record of any issues
* An application integrated into a version control system
  * Using the feature branch model
  * Built through a CI server
  * Deployed to a cloud based virtual machine
  * Must feature a webhook so changes are deployed straight away
* Must follow the service-orinetated architecture provided
* Must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool
* Create an Ansible Playbook
  * Should provision the environment
  
### Risk Assessment <a name="riskassessment"></a>

### Constraints <a name="constraints"></a>
Due to the limited time and training, there were constraints in the project which impacted the choice of technology and services used. The project could only use technologies discussed during the training.

## Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>
As previously mentioned, due to constraints on the project, the following tools where chosen prior to starting the project. The tools and services listed below will be discussed in further detail and how each service was used.

* Kanban Board: Asana or an equivalent Kanban Board
* Version Control: Git
* CI Server: Jenkins
* Configuration Management: Ansible
* Cloud server: GCP virtual machines
* Containerisation: Docker
* Orchestration Tool: Docker Swarm

### Project Tracking <a name="projecttracking"></a>
Trello was used to track progress for the project. Trello provided a card based tracking system which allowed easy tracking of what tasks had to be started, which tasks were in progress and which tasks had been completed. Labels were used to manage cards and what each card had represented e.g. Orange labels were used to show items which were part of the minimum viable product. The Trello board can be accessed through the link below:
